            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>This day being the ſecond Seſſion of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention at <hi>Dublin,</hi> after the adjournment.

Here M. <hi>Cox</hi> an eminent P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eacher of the City, entertained them with a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon full of piety and diſcretion; neither forgetting the Magiſtrate in laying his duty before him, nor himſelf, in running beyond the bounds of the Goſpel, to plunge himſelf over head and ears in matters of State, or another cognizance. He was obſerved to have many Leſſons and two Whips. Firſt for buyers &amp; ſellers, turning all mechanical &amp; unordained Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers out of the Temple: and then, for another ſort of men, who more deſparately whip the Temple it ſelf out of the Temple, by gethering Churches out
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45633:6"/>of Churches. So that after much winnowing, nothing is, leſt the poor Pariſh but the windie chaff and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of Chriſtianity; the good grain being puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied keeps cloſe together in a comfortable private combination. Thus the Preacher. He having with great approbation concluded, the honourable Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Convention departed to the place of their Meeting, and there fell upon the neceſſary work of their Generation.</p>
               <p>This day Sir <hi>James Barry</hi> was much talked of for a noble ſpeech made by him in the Convention, which is elſewhere to be Printed; it being thought worthy to ſtand alone, that it may receive the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the eye in a ſingle encounter, which is loſt in a croud of other buſineſſes.</p>
               <p>After this Speech of Sir <hi>James Barry,</hi> many others inflam'd with the ſucceſs of his fortunate eloquence have ſince playd the good Orators in the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where without popularity aiming onely at the good of the people, (the natural end of artificial ſpeaking) they all as it were with one ſpirit, ſhewed the various perfections of their art, in beautifying one common Theme, to wit, <hi>That the benefit of</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>is chiefly contained in a ſubordination to the authority of Parliament now ſitting in</hi> England. This argument is further confirmed by the greateſt To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick of the nation, the authority of the Convention; by whoſe Order a Declaration is already prepared to be made publick. Note alſo, that the late Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Sir <hi>Charls Coot</hi> and the reſt of the Officers of the Army, inſtead of a laurel, the trivial enſign of out forefathers glory, hath been more remarkably crowned with a full and ample approbation from the Houſe.</p>

               <p>This being the day publiquely ſet apart, and for ſix houres together in Chriſt-Church, ſolemnly ſpent in the exerciſe of Humiliation. Firſt, Mr. <hi>Cox</hi> in a Sermon never to be forgotten, diſchargeth his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and finding in the whole Scripture no words more agreeable to his principles againſt Church-ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, he takes the 19 Verſe of <hi>Judes</hi> Epiſtle for his Text, Thus, <hi>Theſe be the who ſeparate themſelves, ſenſual, having not the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the naming of the words, preſently there fell a kinde of ſpirit of Prophecie upon all the Auditors, ſuppoſing by the very bending of his bow in the text, what the mark was, at preſent, and partly preſent, at which he principally aimed. And ſo he proceeded to diſcover the naked beauty of truth ſo long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. After many judicious and pious Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the circumſtances of his Text, he fell plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to work, telling us that in the notorious and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral iniquity of ſeparation, the people of God were extreamly guilty, and how that the gatherings of Churches out of Churches, under the phantaſtick notion of non-communion with the unregenerate, had in it, not ſo much of Serpents head, it being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all reaſon, as of his tail, in the oblique wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of avarice, pride and indiſcretion, the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit champions of Devotion. Then he informs, when this ſin of Separation took beginning, and putting a diſparagement upon its pedegree, he quarters it with the Levitical coat of <hi>Corah,</hi> and the reſt of his damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Separatiſts. But with ſome ſuppoſed differences: they onely aiming at equality among their brethren, theſe at ſuperiority. They devoured by the earth, theſe in their large poſſeſſions, devouring more earth then indeed the moderation of the former Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Laws, allowed to be Canonical.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:45633:8"/>
               <p>After this he deſcends to his Exhortations of the Magiſtrate, and the concerned people. The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to pluck the branches of Separation out of the fire, (a work to be done rather then ſpoken of.) Then the concerned people, that they indeavour to quench the flames, upon a double account: for firſt, they are generally branded, beſides this, which will be matter of amazement in ſettled times, theſe fires are of their own perticular kindling, excluſively to the publick authority of the Magiſtrate. And to ſpeak plainly, without a complement to Church In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, the fire of martyrdome, this directed to the communion, the other to the diviſion of the Church, is in conſcience more capable of election, ſuppoſing that Chriſt and Mammon are two diſtinct perſons.</p>
               <p>When Mr. <hi>Cox</hi> had run his race in this preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, the worke of Humiliation was carried on by Mr. <hi>Adare</hi> in prayer, with much ardency of zeal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to Gods Glory.</p>
               <p>After him Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> aſcends, who after the ſweet incenſe of his prayer to God, turned himſelfe upon the Auditors in the oblation of this Text, <hi>viz, Iſaiah</hi> 1.25, 26.</p>
               <p>After many holy obſervations, the principall part of his devotion, agreeable to the nature of the times, was to affert the neceſſity of a fixed and ſtanding magiſtracy, ſince the houour of publick authority is never leſſe triumphant than when it rides in a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot whoſe wheels being alwayes turning, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple find nothing but over-turnings, in the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant reſolutions of ſundry factions; Here he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted many documents, as to the ſpirituall intereſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45633:8"/>of Church and State. Then applying himſelfe to the Learned Univerſities of our Nations, (they being as the fountains of the deep and the windows of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) he ſeemed to ground on their corruption, an unavoydable danger, that a deluge of error may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelme the face of our Nations, eſpecially in theſe times, where there is more danger threatned by the overflowing of the waters, then care taken in the building of an Ark for the preſervation of common intereſt.</p>
               <p>To this exerciſe of Humiliation, the ſacred Seale was affixed by Mr. <hi>Bains</hi> in prayer, of whoſe words the beſt account that can be given, will manifeſt it ſelf in the heavenly bleſſings of our proceedings. Onely thus is noted of him, that in the Pillar of the wilderneſſe, when nothing but the cloud appears, he followes his conſcience. But when the other face is turned, with light he follows reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> 9. Ordered, That Sir <hi>John Clotworthy,</hi> Dr. <hi>Jones,</hi> and Col. <hi>Hill</hi> be and are hereby appointed a Committee to return the thanks of this Convention to M. <hi>Cox,</hi> M. <hi>Charnock,</hi> M. <hi>Adare</hi> and M. <hi>Bains,</hi> for their pains in carrying on the work of this day in <hi>Chriſtchurch, Dublin:</hi> and that M. <hi>Cox</hi> and M. <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock</hi> be deſired to print their reſpective Sermons this day by them delivered before the Convention.</p>
